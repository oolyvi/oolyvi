The Android developer who's trying to do something for nothing. My codes is like a captivating novel by Dostoyevsky, once you start, it is hard to stop. They are a mix of both sadness and happiness as our lives, once you experience it, you'll want to come back for more, but maybe you want to get out of it as well. Don't worry too much about what I wrote above, I'm not even explaining what I wrote, just try to code our lives and the world ;)
